1. Finish stochastic gradient decending for logistic learning
2. Decide if I should just learn once and forget, or use a different approach (store transition->delta)
3. Write a heuristic interface so I can export the predictions.
4. [Theory]. Assuming it is a non-biased prediction of the heuristic function (Gaussian)
5.        heuristic function is a biased or non-biased estimation of the true distance
          when it is not distingitive, it is hiding the weak signal of distance differences.
          a non-biased estimator can re-introduce random factors into the system, therefore
          will be a new, indenepending Gaussian.
          Need a metric to show how good a heuristic is under certain standard.
6. Plot a pleatau graph
